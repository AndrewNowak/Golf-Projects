# Golf-Projects
Using golf data to make predictions


This project at the moment looks like a giant mess as it has come together. Fruther efforts will be made to try to organize and accumulate functions so that it can be ran in a sequential order.


Many of the functions require MySQL databases to already be created and formated correctly without any assistance on how to create them, which is, to say the least, unfortunate. Future capacilites will hopefully adress this issue.


After everything is created, the manin functions will be to upload new tournament data after the resilution of each tournament, fill tables with new tournaments as a new season begins, and run the model to accumulate projected stadnings.

The main functions to use will be tourn_scrape_add_new and web_scraping_function. A new tournamnet project script is being developed.
